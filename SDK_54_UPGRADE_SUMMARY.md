3. **React Native 0.81.4**: This is a major React Native upgrade with potential breaking changes. Test thoroughly.

### Testing Recommendations

1. **iOS Testing**:

   ```bash
   npm run ios:simulator
   npm run ios:device
   ```

2. **Android Testing**:

   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

3. **Web Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:web
   ```

### Build Commands

- **Development**: `npm run dev`
- **iOS Build**: `npm run build:ios`
- **Android Build**: `npm run build:android`
- **Prebuild**: `npm run prebuild:ios` or `npm run prebuild:android`

### Performance Improvements

SDK 54.0.0 includes:

- React Native 0.81.4 performance improvements
- Enhanced New Architecture support
- Better iOS build times with precompiled XCFrameworks
- Improved Expo Router v6 functionality

### Breaking Changes to Watch

1. **React Native 0.81.4**: Check for any deprecated APIs
2. **Expo Router v6**: Review routing changes if any
3. **Reanimated v4**: Check animation implementations
4. **New Architecture**: Ensure all native modules are compatible
